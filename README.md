# JoeRock_Xamarin-Android_Tutorial

Welcome!

This repository is made for [Joe Rock's Xamarin Tutorial video-series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuRg51-gw5VqYchUekCqxUS9hEZkDf6l). 

As there was no source code for Joe's tutorial videos, I've decided to make them myself, following through every video.

If you want the source code, you can download the zips in the releases. Every release covers 1 video.


Note that my code may differ a bit from the videos.

Joe started the tutorial series in 2014, thus his Visual Studio is an older version than mine. Because of that, things in Visual Studio have changed quite a bit. Though
that should not stop you from having almost the same results as Joe.

If you have troubles with anything, just leave a note under the [Discussions](https://github.com/GogoDeveloper/JoeRock_Xamarin-Android_Tutorial/discussions)-tab.
